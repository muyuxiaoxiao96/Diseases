The mid-winter peak ranges from 20% to as much as 70% above the mid-summer trough. The winter excess of deaths in any particular year is strongly correlated with coldness, but not significantly with either air pollution or rainfall. A decrease in mortality with an increase in temperature is evident across the entire observed temperature range, although the magnitude of the effect decreases exponentially. It appears that changes in temperature are responsible for most of the short-term fluctuations in ischaemic heart disease mortality.",

For Hampshire, West Midlands, Greater Manchester, and West Yorkshire, this decrease in mortality peak amplitude occurs without any significant changes in temperature seasonality, which may indicate desensitization of the study populations to the relative effects of temperature seasonality on mortality seasonality. This corroborates the findings for other countries such as Germany (Lerchl 1998), Japan (Honda 2000), Scotland (Gemmel et al. 2000), and the United States (Seretakis 1997), where declines in mortality seasonality have been noted. A likely explanation for this is the improvement in the nature of housing stock, the increased use and availability of home heating, and the advancement of health systems.",

The results revealed significant changes in the winter hospitalization rates, with different trends observed among the age groups and genders.

This finding that higher greenness was associated with slightly lower blood pressure among individuals with T2D in townships, the majority of whom had a hypertension diagnosis, suggests that the natural environment may have salutogenic effects even when arterial disease has been established. The lack of significant associations among borough and city residents tentatively suggests a threshold effect, whereby high levels of greenness are necessary to influence blood pressure in this population. This study adds to the growing body of evidence connecting the natural environment and health, with implications for health-promoting community design.",

     "Comments|Finding": "The study suggests that living at intermediate high altitudes can worsen the condition of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF). Altitude-related mechanisms, such as increased sympathetic activity, oxygenation demand, and pulmonary pressure, contribute to exacerbating their condition. As a result, patients with HFREF at these altitudes should receive closer monitoring and follow-up. Larger, multicenter studies are needed to validate these findings.",

     "Comments|Finding": "The paper's main finding is that there is an association between temperature and mortality from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in six Brazilian metropolitan areas. In areas with higher thermal amplitude, AMI mortality increases in winter, whereas in areas closer to the equator, temperature was not associated with AMI mortality, regardless of whether it was low or high. Furthermore, mortality from hypothermia-related AMI is associated with physiological characteristics of the cardiovascular system, particularly in the elderly. The effect of heat on mortality varies by region and may be related to adaptability and resilience. Additionally, the interaction between temperature and pollution also has an impact on mortality. These findings could provide a scientific basis for policies to mitigate the effects of climate on health.",

Children were screened by physical examination, and an echocardiogram and electrocardiogram were performed on each child suspected of having a cardiac anomaly. A high prevalence of patent ductus arteriosus and atrial septal defect was found at the three high altitude sites and the effect of altitude was progressive. Both anomalies were hypothesized to be the result of the lower atmospheric oxygen tension present at high altitude.",

The heat-related YLL from cardiovascular diseases is projected to increase 3.1 to 11.5 times under 19 GCMs and 3 RCPs in the 2050s and 2070s, even when taking 30% adaptation into consideration. These results provide evidence for policy-making and resource allocation to address the dual problem of climate change and an aging population.",

     "Comments|Finding": "The study findings revealed that the number of hospital admissions exhibited a positive correlation with three air pollutants (SO₂, r=0.064, P>0.05; NO₂, r=0.152, P<0.05; PM10, r=0.027, P>0.05). Conversely, humidity displayed a negative correlation with cardiovascular disease (CVD) (r=−0.015, P>0.05). Furthermore, during the transition from cold to warm, the number of hospitalizations showed minimal changes; however, as the temperature shifted from warm to cold, the hospitalizations increased. The most pronounced detrimental impact of low temperatures on CVD occurred approximately two to four days after exposure and gradually diminished in subsequent days, only to reappear after a lag of 25 days. On the other hand, the maximum harmful effect of high temperatures manifested with a time lag of 10 to 17 days. The study also observed that individuals below 65 years of age and males were more susceptible to low temperatures, whereas those aged 65 or above and females demonstrated higher vulnerability to high temperatures.",

The relative effect on mortality due to cardiovascular disease was slightly larger than that for total mortality, but much weaker than for respiratory mortality. In absolute terms, about one-half of all cold-related deaths (4.71 deaths|day|1°C cold during the last month) were due to cardiovascular diseases (2.42 deaths|day|1°C cold during the last month).

     "Comments|Finding": "This study found that patients with underlying cardiovascular conditions, such as heart disease, had a 14% increased likelihood of emergency hospital admissions after experiencing three consecutive days of extremely high temperatures compared to individuals without heart disease. Additionally, individual characteristics that could increase subject susceptibility to extreme heat were also examined, including those aged more than 75 years, more than 65 years, less than 4 years, male, and living at a nursing home. However, none of these characteristics significantly modified the overall risk of emergency admission to hospitals, although the results were not shown in the article.",

     "Comments|Finding": "This research found that a 6% increase in 1-month and 7% increase in 3-month all-cause mortality after Hurricane Sandy. Excess mortality was consistent with that observed in other studies.9,10 Noninfectious respiratory and infectious disease death excesses were significantly higher for the Sandy quarter, but not the month, which is consistent with longer disease processes or a lag in the development of harmful exposures. For cardiovascular disease mortality, an excess was observed for the quarter. Unintentional injury death excesses were greatest during the Sandy month. Elderly persons were especially vulnerable, as were those living in communities with the greatest storm impact.",
